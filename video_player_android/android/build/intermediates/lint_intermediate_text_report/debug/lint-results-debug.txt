C:\Users\vladi\source\repos\loadapp_flutter\loadapp Flutter\loadapp Flutter\packages\video_player\video_player_android\android\build.gradle:73: Warning: Do not use Windows file separators in .gradle files; use / instead [GradlePath]
    implementation files('libs\\flutter.jar')
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradlePath":
   Gradle build scripts are meant to be cross platform, so file paths use
   Unix-style path separators (a forward slash) rather than Windows path
   separators (a backslash). Similarly, to keep projects portable and
   repeatable, avoid using absolute paths on the system; keep files within the
   project instead. To share code between projects, consider creating an
   android-library and an AAR dependency
